        <h3>DBSA & Masare</h3>
        <p>Dream Makers is a student-led charity from China, dedicated to supporting children in African slums. Starting with building schools, the organization now runs multiple programs in Nairobi’s Mathare, including Hope Campus, Talent Show, Football Matches, and Art Training. Volunteers undergo rigorous nationwide recruitment and planning, backed by donors like Transsion Techno and local institutions.</p>

        <h3>Kenya Chinese Chamber of Commerce</h3>
        <p>Founded in 2017, the Kenya Chinese Chamber of Commerce serves as a bridge for Chinese entrepreneurs and the local community. During our visit, we met Chairman Zhuo Wu and senior members to discuss business, smart cities, public good, and coexistence.</p>

        <h3> Soysambu</h3>
        <p>Nestled in the Great Rift Valley of East Africa, Soysambu Conservancy covers 48,000 hectares of shrubland and savanna, bordering Kenya’s Lake Nakuru National Park. Its mission is to protect endangered species—especially Rothschild’s giraffe—while fostering harmony with neighboring communities and exploring sustainable conservation models for the valley’s future.
Together with the NGO Yi Xing Future, we joined both conservation and public service projects during our stay.</p>

        <h3>Maasai Mara National Part</h3>
        <p>Africa holds the world’s richest wildlife resources, a vital stronghold of global biodiversity. Yet its animals face unprecedented pressure: poaching persists, habitats shrink, and human activity increasingly collides with fragile ecosystems. How to balance wildlife protection, land use, and community development has become a central question for Africa’s ecological future.</p>

        <h3>Nyungu Africa</h3>
        <p>On July 10, in Thika—the heart of Kenya’s pineapple country—we met Mary. Once a journalist, now a pioneer, she has turned agricultural waste into sustainable sanitary pads, redefining what women’s health empowerment can mean.</p>

        <h3>Farmworks Visit</h3>
        <p>Agriculture is the backbone of life, yet in many African countries, low yields—just 10–20% of those in developed nations—mean food security remains a challenge. Many countries even rely on imports. This sparked our question: Can Africa achieve self-sufficiency through technology and organization? Can smallholders scale up and escape low-efficiency farming?</p>
